                    Orochimaru </h1>
                <p>Orochimaru was one of the Sannin, who made a name for themselves in the Second Great Ninja War.
                    Orochimaru had knowledge about almost every kind of jutsu, and because of that knowledge, he
                    developed new jutsu and perfected many old ones.<br>

                    Strongest Ability and Biggest Feat: Orochimaru lived through the era of various powerful ninjas.
                    Over time, he amassed a great deal of information, and eventually, he found the jutsu to become
                    "immortal." Orochimaru's biggest feat is surviving a fight against Naruto, who was using his four
                    tails form.</p>
