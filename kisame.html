                <h1>Kisame</h1>
                <p>Partnered with Itachi in Akatsuki, Kisame defected from Kirigakure and became a missing ninja. Kisame
                    wielded Samehada, one of the legendary swords. This weapon possessed the frightening ability to
                    absorb chakra.<br>

                    Kisame had incredible chakra reserves, which led to his moniker "Tailless Tailed Beast." He was able
                    to overwhelm several jinchuriki with ease. Kisame has many noteworthy feats to his name, including
                    getting the better of Asuma and capturing jinchuriki.<br>

                    Strongest Ability and Biggest Feat: Kisame was a no-nonsense ninja who would see to it that the
                    mission was completed at all costs. Kisame's most powerful ability was being able to absorb the
                    chakra from other jutsu. His biggest feat is surviving the onslaught of Guy, who was using the Sixth
                    Gate.</p>
