                <h1>Pain</h1>
                <p>The Six Paths of Pain were created by Nagato Uzumaki, who used chakra rods to manipulate the bodies
                    to fight for him. Each body had a different ability of the Rinnegan, and their vision was linked to
                    each other.<br>

                    A single attack from Tendo Pain wiped out more than half of the Hidden Leaf. Naruto needed all the
                    effort and luck he could muster to bring down all the bodies of Pain. If Nagato was fit to fight
                    himself, he could have killed Naruto very easily.<br>

                    Strongest Ability and Biggest Feat: The Six Paths of Pain were extremely powerful. Each body wielded
                    the Rinnegan, but they only had one ability. The strongest ability of the Six Paths of Pain was
                    being able to absorb ninjutsu. While Tendo Pain was able to destroy a chunk of the Hidden Leaf, it
                    doesn't compare to what Nagato did to Killer B and Naruto. After being reanimated, Nagato was able
                    to take on both jinchuuriki, and he was nearly successful in killing them.</p>
