                <h1>Obito Uchiha</h1>
                <p>The world presumed Obito dead after the Third Great Ninja War. However, he was saved by Madara
                    Uchiha, who wanted Obito to do his bidding. Obito had the Mangekyou Sharingan, which had a unique
                    ability called Kamui.<br>

                    Using Kamui, Obito could send part of his body or other objects to the Kamui dimension. He could
                    make parts of his body intangible, allowing attacks to faze through him. Obito also knew the
                    forbidden techniques of the Uchiha Clan, such as the Izanagi.<br>

                    Strongest Ability and Biggest Feat: Obito was a cunning individual, and he was able to start the
                    Fourth Great Ninja War due to his ability to manipulate other people. During the war, Obito gained
                    the Rinnegan and later unlocked the powers unique to the jinchuuriki of the Ten-Tails. With such
                    enormous power, Obito managed to overwhelm nearly the entire Shinobi Alliance.</p>
