                <h1>Konan</h1>
                <p>Konan was one of the three Amegakure orphans whom Jiraiya trained. After Yahiko's death, Konan took
                    care of Nagato. She was a very powerful ninja who specialized in origami, using it in her fights
                    against her opponents.<br>

                    Konan was a perceptive person, who managed to find out a way to counter Obito's space-time ninjutsu.
                    She was also able to overwhelm Obito in a fight, and the latter only managed to survive because of
                    the Izanagi.

                    Strongest Ability and Biggest Feat: Konan is among the most underrated characters in the series. Her
                    most powerful ability was called Paper Person of God. With the help of this jutsu, Konan nearly
                    killed Obito.</p>
